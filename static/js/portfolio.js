/*
For the works, caption + hover would be good. Like "what am I clicking on?"
Add info about the skill set that I applied for each work
Expand more on the about, another paragraph of that size would be good, it needs to be more personal and make the user feel like they know me as a person after reading it.
Add resume, probably in one of the top tabs.
When clicking on contact, it's not clear because the icons are in the footer, can add a section for form submission.
Portfolio is good in that it's concrete, "this is what I've done"
Maybe right under the large name at the top, then immediately the position (undergraduate cs major at UCSD), then read the more refined bio
Add caption over stuff / watermark, thought at first that I didn't create those images and that I'd just found them on the web.
Works should open in new window so that the user still stays on the main page.
Should have a pic of self, but doesn't have to be a real picture, could be some sort of representation like https://github.com/AlexOuyang
Make the banner with real name instead of Kyzer, because people don't know who Kyzer is
Have a new page with description for each work.
